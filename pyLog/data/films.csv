A pesar de que su trabajo implica el manejo de estudiantes ruidosos, expresa su pasión por la música y el jazz con sus excelentes habilidades en el piano. Se le ofrece un puesto a tiempo completo en la escuela que le concierne ya que quiere ser un músico a tiempo completo. Su madre, Libba, quiere que acepte, ya que eso lo mantendría económicamente seguro. Por casualidad, su ex-alumno Curly revela que la música de jazz Dorothea Williams está haciendo audiciones abiertas para un pianista en el Club Half Note. Joe llega y toca el piano maravillosamente hasta el punto de que Dorothea le ofrece el trabajo en el acto. Mientras Joe se dirige felizmente a preparar la actuación de esta noche, se cae por una alcantarilla. Joe se encuentra como un alma que se dirige al ""Gran Después"". No queriendo morir todavía, escapa del camino del transportador y se encuentra en el ""Gran Antes"", también llamado ""El seminario de yo"", donde los consejeros de almas, todos llamados Jerry, crean almas jóvenes para la vida en la tierra. Joe se hace pasar por un instructor que está listo para entrenar a las almas y se le da a 22, un alma que ha permanecido en el Gran Antes durante muchos años. A 22 no le gusta la tierra, la encuentra inútil y hace a propósito que sus antiguos instructores la dejen en paz. Joe le revela a 22 la verdadera razón por la que está aquí y mira su vida hasta el punto en que supuestamente murió. Se da cuenta de que no ha hecho mucho con su vida, lo que le da un mayor incentivo para volver. 22 revela que tiene una placa que se llena de rasgos. Necesita encontrar su ""chispa"" para completarla y dice que se la dará a Joe para que pueda volver a casa. Joe intenta que 22 encuentre algo que le apasione, pero nada funciona. Sin más opciones, ella lo lleva a ""la zona"", un área en la que la gente entra cuando su pasión los pone en un trance eufórico. También alberga a las almas perdidas que se obsesionan con cosas menores. Se encuentran con Moonwind, un girador de señales que entra en la zona para rescatar almas perdidas. Acepta ayudar a Joe a volver a su cuerpo, y se enteran de que ha caído en coma y está en soporte vital. Joe salta emocionado de vuelta a la tierra, pero accidentalmente trae a 22 con él, lo que resulta en que 22 entran en su cuerpo y Joe termina en el cuerpo de un gato de terapia. Mientras tanto, Terry, una contadora del Gran Antes, se da cuenta de que las almas del Gran Antes están mal contadas y se entera rápidamente de que Joe ha desaparecido y convence a los Jerrys para que la dejen ir a buscarlo para traerlo de vuelta. 22 y Joe escapan del hospital, y la primera se asusta por las vistas y los sonidos. Joe la tranquiliza dándole una pizza, permitiéndole disfrutar de algo por primera vez. Se encuentran con Moonwind, quien les dice que puede intentar devolverles sus cuerpos, pero después de salir del trabajo a las 6:30, se acerca al espectáculo de Joe a las 7:00. Se dirigen al apartamento de Joe donde Connie, una de las estudiantes de Joe, llega para decirle que deja la banda. Sin embargo, 22 escucha su trombón y cambia de opinión, lo que la deja perpleja. A continuación se van a cortar el pelo donde 22 mantiene una conversación con Dez el barbero, y los dos mantienen una conversación muy conmovedora entre ellos. Después de que 22 le rasgue los pantalones a Joe, van a ver a Libba para que se los arregle y ""Joe"" finalmente tiene una charla seria con ella sobre su pasión, lo que resulta en que Libba le da a Joe el viejo traje de su padre. Fuera del club, 22 tiene una epifanía sobre muchas de las cosas que ha vivido y decide que quiere vivir. No queriendo volver a cambiar, ella corre y Joe la persigue. Terry los alcanza y los saca de sus cuerpos y regresa al Gran Antes donde 22 ve que su placa ha sido rellenada. Sin embargo, Joe le dice que ella estaba usando sus experiencias y que no importa. Enojada, le tira la placa y desaparece en la zona. Joe aprende de un Jerry que una ""chispa"" y un ""propósito"" no son la misma cosa, y vuelve a la tierra donde llega al club a tiempo. Después de tocar por la noche, Joe no se siente bien con lo que pasó y regresa a casa. Cambiado por la experiencia de 22, Joe entra en la zona y se reúne con Moonwind para buscar a 22 que se ha convertido en un alma perdida. Joe persigue a 22 de vuelta al Gran Antes e intenta devolverle su placa, pero termina dentro de ella. 22 se siente desesperada y destrozada por su propósito, con Joe tratando de hacerla sentir mejor. Tomando un pequeño pétalo que llamó la atención de 22 antes, Joe se lo da y ella vuelve a la normalidad. Con su placa de vuelta, Joe cabalga con ella lo más lejos que puede ya que 22 finalmente entra en la tierra. Joe está preparado para dirigirse al Gran Antes, pero es detenido por un Jerry que le dice que los ha inspirado y que le dará otra oportunidad en la vida (decidieron simplemente distraer a Terry de su conteo). Joe les da las gracias y regresa a la vida, ahora con la intención de vivir su vida al máximo.",https://disney.fandom.com/es/wiki/Soul

Ratatouille,"Ratatouille is Pixar's eighth feature film. It was released in theaters on June 29, 2007. Ratatouille is the last Pixar film to use the CGI 1995 Walt Disney Pictures logo. It's also the first to be released after Disney purchased the company.","The movie opens with a televised document about Auguste Gusteau, a French chef who is the owner of a 5-star restaurant in Paris, Gusteau's, being the youngest chef to ever have a 5-star rating and having a best selling book, Anyone Can Cook. Everyone loved Gusteau, except for food critic Anton Ego, who throughout the years, tries to put down Gusteau's reputation as he doesn't believe in his motto, ""Anyone can cook.""

The movie then shifts to Remy, a young rat who lives in the attic of a French country home owned by a old woman with his brother Emile and a pack led by his father Django. Remy is gifted with a keen sense of smell and taste, which he used to save his father from eating food that was covered with rat poison. By this point, Django suddenly believed that Remy's gift was great. Remy felt pleased about this, until Django gave him the job of being poison checker, which involved smelling all the stolen food to tell whether it was poisoned or not. Unlike the other rats, Remy dislikes garbage food and is fascinated by the humans, to Django's dismay. Django forbids Remy to go into the kitchen (where all the food isn't poison) and away from the humans as they are dangerous. But Remy ignores it and goes into the kitchen of the house and watches a document of Gusteau in which Remy is heavily inspired by.

The next day, Remy discovers a mushroom, and with the help of Emile, Remy cooks the mushroom with the cheese Emile found on the rooftop of the house. However, lightning strikes the two, but it also cooks the mushroom Remy was preparing, in which Remy takes a huge liking too. Remy wants to add saffron to it, but it is in the kitchen. As Remy searches for it, Emile is feeling really uncomfortable being in the kitchen, scared that the old lady will wake up. Aside from his great sense of smell, Remy also reveals that he can read and have watched television, something rats never do and approve of. As Django gets impatience waiting on Remy and Emile, Remy shows the document of Gusteau to Emile on the television. But the document reveals that Gusteau has passed away after Ego's negative review cost the restaurant its 5-star rating, shocking Remy. The old lady wakes up and is shocked to see both Remy and Emile. She grabs a shotgun and shoots at the two. Emile tries to run back into the colony, but the old lady shoots the roof causing Emile to hang loose on the chandelier. Remy saves Emile and return to the colony as the old lady tries to reload her gun. She succeeds and shoots the roof but fails to kill the two. The roof breaks open, revealing the colony, shocking the old lady even more. The rats evacuate, but Remy returns to get the book. As the last rat in the house, the old lady returns with rat poison. Remy successfully escapes and tries to catch up with the clan, who are on their escape boats on a river. Remy tries to catch up, but the old lady shoots at them. Remy tries to catch up with them by paddling with the spatula they gave him. Remy loses the clan after taking a wrong turn and falling into a waterfall and through a series of rapids.

Remy finds land and awaits for the clan to find him, but the clan never did. Remy reads Gusteau's book and gets hungry, in which an imaginary figure of Gusteau appears in front of his eyes. Urged on by Gusteau, Remy makes his way up to the sewers and into an apartment complex, where he finds bread. Gusteau however stops Remy and tells him that ""a cook makes, a thief takes"". Remy decides to leave and heads to the roof of the apartment, to find that he's been below Paris all along and finds Gusteau's restaurant. In the kitchen of the restaurant, a young man named Alfredo Linguini awaits in the kitchen to meet the chef, Skinner, the restaurant's current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. Linguini is the son of Renata, one of Gusteau's ex-girlfriends who recently passed away. Linguini gives Skinner a letter from his mother in hopes that it'll help him get a job at the restaurant. Skinner ignores this, but the kitchen chef seems to already hired him, as the garbage boy. Meanwhile, Remy heads to the restaurant's kitchen skylight to watch the staff in action and identifies the roles of each kitchen staff. He also observes Linguini, who he calls a nobody working in the kitchen. When Linguini spills some of the soup and attempts to recreate it using random ingredients, Remy is horrified and enraged. Overreacting, Remy accidentally falls into the kitchen's sink. He tries to escape, but his attempts always failed as he gets knocked out numerous times. As he finally had the chance to escape, Remy gets caught up remaking the horrid soup Linguini created by adding in species to his liking. Encouraged by Gusteau, Remy decides to fix the soup only to be caught by Linguini. As Skinner comes to get the soup, Linguini traps Remy and is caught by Skinner, in which Skinner believed that Linguini was cooking in his kitchen. However, during the confrontation, someone took some of the soup to serve it to a guest. Observing the guest's reaction to the soup, Skinner had believed the soup was a failure and angrily fires Linguini, until the guest asked for the chef. The guest turns out to be Solene LeClaire, a food critic who likes the soup and found it a success. Skinner doesn't believe that Linguini actually makes the soup and still is on the verge to fire him. However, Colette, the staff's only female chef, convinces Skinner to retain Linguini, believing him to be behind the success of the soup. Also, she reminds Skinner of Gusteau's motto and that if he was to be fired after LeClaire writes the review about it, the restaurant would lose their reputation. Skinner decides to keep Linguini and let Colette take care of him. As Remy is escaping, he is discovered by Skinner. Linguini traps Remy in a jar and Skinner orders him to kill him, away from the kitchen.

Linguini heads to the river to drown Remy. But Linguini halts and realizes that Remy is the creator of the soup and asks if Remy could help him recreate it. Linguini frees Remy but Remy escapes. However, Remy returns to Linguini, realizing that he can't let him down and that he saved him from drowning. The next day, Remy and Linguini had a hard time overcoming their language barrier, until Remy starts pulling Linguini's hair under his toque blanche to control his limbs like a marionette. The pair successfully meet the challenges devised by Skinner. He becomes concerned about Linguini's talent and discovers that Linguini is actually Gusteau's son and the rightful owner of the restaurant; this revelation would ruin Skinner's plans to use Gusteau's name to market a line of microwaveable meals. He calls his lawyer, who confirms that Linguini is Gusteau's son through a hair in the late chef's hat. With Skinner faced with the dilemma of not firing Linguini without it looking suspicious, his lawyer advises that he'll have to wait until the deadline on Gusteau's will is over before doing so. However, Remy discovers the documents and takes them to Linguini, who subsequently fires Skinner and takes control of the restaurant. Linguini and Colette even begin to develop a romantic bond, leaving Remy feeling left out and taken for granted. Remy finds Emile in the restaurant's trash, and Remy is reunited with the pack. Django warns Remy that humans and rats will never get along, but Remy does not believe him. Meanwhile, Remy begrudgingly feeds Emile and his friends by stealing from the kitchen's pantry as the nights pass.

Not long after, Anton Ego announces he will review the restaurant again the next day based on its rising success. Linguini, under pressure of Ego's pending arrival, has a falling out with Remy, causing Remy to retaliate by leading a raid on the kitchen's foodstocks that night. Linguini catches the rats in the act and chases them all out, including Remy, threatening to treat him the same way restaurants always mistreat rats, should he come back. Remy, dejected, is captured by Skinner. In the cage, Remy has one final conversation with his phantom Gusteau, who tells him that he never needed his guidance and at that moment, he is freed by Django and Emile. Remy returns to the kitchen, where a frantic Linguini apologizes and asks Remy back to help. Linguini then reveals the truth about Remy, resulting in a mass walk-out by the heartbroken staff; Colette later returns after recalling Gusteau's motto.

Impressed by his son's determination, Django organizes the rest of the pack to help out in the kitchen. They throw Skinner and a health inspector, bound and gagged, into the freezer when they try to interfere. Linguini uses roller skates to wait on all the tables by himself, while Remy and Colette work together to prepare a variation on ratatouille for Ego. Ego is amazed by the dish, which evokes childhood memories of his mother's cooking, and asks to see the chef. Linguini and Colette wait until all the other customers leave to introduce Remy to Ego. Ego writes a glowing review of the meal the next day about how he truly understands Gusteau's motto, and declares Remy (without revealing his name and that he is a rat) as ""nothing less than the finest chef in France.""

After Skinner and the health inspector are released, the restaurant is shut down shortly afterwards, causing Ego to lose his job and credibility for praising a restaurant filled with rats. However, he eagerly funds a new bistro run by Linguini and Colette, featuring dining areas for both humans and rats and a kitchen designed for Remy to continue cooking. The closing of the movie shows a long queue outside and a sign displaying a rat wearing a toque and holding a spoon, and below it the name ""La Ratatouille"" as the rat colony settles into their new home in the bistro's attic.",https://pixar.fandom.com/wiki/Ratatouille

His dreams are scorned by his boss Leadbottom and his forklift friend Dottie. However, he is supported by his fuel truck friend Chug. Dusty and Chug train for qualifiers for the upcoming Wings Across the Globe race. On the night before the qualifiers, Dusty asks an elderly and reclusive navy war plane named Skipper Riley to teach him how to fly well but Skipper refuses. Dusty enters the qualifiers, and although the audience mocks him for being a crop duster, he manages to wow them by his well-practiced flight maneuvers, but comes in 6th place and is the back-up qualifier. A few days later, a representative from the qualifier visits his town looking for Dusty and announces to him that he now placed 5th. He barely makes it into the race due to the qualifier ahead of Dusty used a fuel enhancement ultimately getting disqualified from the race.Later in the morning, Skipper visits Dusty and tries to talk him out of racing, but when Dusty explains he wants to prove he's more than just a crop duster, Skipper decides to mentor Dusty on his speed and agility. While in the midst of his training, Dusty admits that he has a fear of heights. Despite this, their training continues and when it is complete, Dusty heads off to the meeting of the race at John F. Kennedy Airport where he finds a friend in a crazy but loyal Mexican race-plane named El Chupacabra who eventually falls in love with a beautiful French-Canadian racer named Rochelle, who shows little interest in him. Dusty then makes a rival of the arrogant and villainous 3-time winner plane Ripslinger, who rudely dismisses him as being only a crop duster. Dusty also falls in love with a racer plane named Ishani, who becomes supportive of him. During the first leg of the race from New York to Iceland, Dusty's refusal to fly high causes him to finish in last place ultimately due to him collecting ice on the wings from the freezing ocean spray and his endurance level to cope with the temperature. During the second leg of the race to Germany, Dusty shows good sportsmanship by saving another racer, Bulldog, from crashing when Bulldog's eyes get squirted with oil from one of his propellers because of an overheated engine, thus winning Bulldog's respect but finishing last again.In India, Ishani gives Dusty some advice on how to fly low through the Himalayas by following some railroad tracks. However, he is forced to fly through a tunnel and narrowly avoids a head-on collision with a steam train, but miraculously finishes first in Nepal.

In Shanghai, Dusty manages to help El Chupacabra win Rochelle over with a romantic song, which works a little too well. In the next race across the Pacific Ocean, Ripslinger's henchmen Ned and Zed, under orders from Ripslinger, sabotage Dusty's navigation antenna. Lost and low on fuel, Dusty miraculously is found by two Super Hornets who escort him to the USS ""Flysenhower"" (a reference to the real-life carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69)) which allows him to land and refuel. While on the carrier, Dusty sees a hall of fame set up for Skipper's squadron, but discovers Skipper only flew one mission, which contradicts his previous reputation as a veteran of many battles. He is then forced to take off in order to try and beat an oncoming storm.Dusty gets distracted from flying due to his thoughts about Skipper and ends up crashing into the ocean but is eventually rescued.

A sequel, Incredibles 2, was released on June 15, 2018.","The film is set in a 1960s-esque alternate universe where superheroes, also known to the public community as Supers, are renowned and commended for their heroic deeds worldwide, allowing them the luxuries of a Golden Age. One particular superhero who truly lives in this age is the super-strong Mr. Incredible, engaged to the amazingly flexible and dexterous Elastigirl and best friends with the cryokinetic Frozone. While driving to his wedding with Elastigirl, Mr. Incredible experiences an otherwise routine day of fighting crime and saving lives, including rescuing a man, Oliver Sansweet, from falling off a building and stopping a train from falling off its track. In addition to confronting an infamous member of his rogue's gallery Bomb Voyage, Mr. Incredible must deal with the intrusion of his self-proclaimed #1 fan, Buddy Pine, who tries to impose himself as Mr. Incredible's sidekick, ""IncrediBoy"". Constantly frustrated by the boy's presence, Mr. Incredible coldly rebuffs him each and every time he appears. After he gets married, Mr. Incredible ends up sued by the man he saved earlier for ruining his attempt to commit suicide, while the victims of the train rescue are suing for the injuries they have sustained even though they might have been killed, had it not been for Mr. Incredible's intervention. These lawsuits left people across the world to sue Supers everywhere for the collateral damage and recklessness caused by their heroics, thus resulting in the suits to cost the government a lot of money. Not long after, the government gave Supers amnesty from responsibility for past actions, in exchange for the promise to never again continue being heroes.Fifteen years later, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl have settled into relatively normal lives. Now known by their secret identities, Bob and Helen Parr, they have a house in the suburbs and are raising three kids: 14-year-old daughter Violet, 10-year-old son Dash, and 1-year-old infant son Jack-Jack though, in a deleted scene, Syndrome says that it's against the law for Supers to marry and have kids. Like their parents, Violet and Dash have their own powers: Violet can turn invisible and create force fields, Dash can run at breakneck speeds, and Jack-Jack is seemingly a normal baby without powers. Bob is overweight and frustrated with the drudgery of his job as a claims adjuster for a corrupt insurance company called Insuricare and secretly helps deserving clients to find loopholes to get their payments. He dreams of returning back to his glory days of being a superhero, going so far as to moonlight as a vigilante by listening to a police scanner every Wednesday, with his friend Frozone, known now as Lucius Best, claiming to their wives that they're going bowling, though Lucius actually wants to go. They have discovered that another former superhero named Gazerbeam has had trouble adjusting to civilian life like Bob does and is now missing. They go to save people from a burning building, but the heat is too much for Lucius to put out with his powers. They accidentally run into the nearby jewelry store, where the security guard assumes they are robbers, Lucius freezes him with the water from the nearby dispenser. When Helen finds out about Bob's nighttime escapades, it causes an argument, Bob hates having to hide their gifts, and wants to return to the heroics of the old days, while Helen is concerned about keeping the family together and not having to start over again by going into hiding in a brand-new location.Eventually, Mr. Huph, Bob's miserly boss, suspects Bob is helping clients and reprimands him. During the lecture, Bob notices a person being mugged in the street. Mr. Huph stops Bob from going to the victim's aid, threatening to fire him, and the mugger escapes. When Huph smugly begins lecturing again, Bob, furious with his insensitivity, grabs him by the neck and hurls him through several office walls and hit black cupboards. Huph is hospitalized with broken bones and sprained left arm and left leg, and Bob is fired. Normally the government agent and Bob's old friend Rick Dicker would cover such an incident by paying to keep the company quiet, relocating his family, and erasing memories of the incident, but since it is costing too much money for the government, Dicker says that he can no longer help Bob, but quickly relents and offers to bail him out one last time, an offer that Bob refuses since his family has adjusted to their current life. While Bob is trying to figure out how to tell Helen about his accident, Mirage, a mysterious agent, contacts him and offers highly paid work subduing a renegade robot, the Omnidroid 08, on Nomanisan, an uncharted volcanic island. Bob takes the assignment, telling Helen that he is attending a conference out of town, hiding both the loss of his job and the renewal of hero work. While on a jet to Nomanisan, Mirage briefs Bob now Mr. Incredible again about how his mission is going to go, and how he needs to subdue the Omnidroid find a way to nuetralize it without completely destroying it beyond salvation and do it quickly before it figures out how to kill him Mr. Incredible lands on the island and begins searching. He finds the Omnidroid and an epic battle ensues. Mr. Incredible defeats the Omnidroid, and with the hefty reward he begins to lead a much happier life with his family. However, he has slightly damaged his supersuit from the battle, and takes it to its designer, the flamboyant Edna Mode, for repairs. Edna also offers to create a brand-new suit for him, and he accepts but, unbeknownst to him, she also creates matching suits for his entire family.Two months later, Mirage calls Bob with a new assignment. Helen overhears the call but does not realize its full implications or content and begins to have suspicions of an affair, though she nervously keeps it to herself. When Mr. Incredible returns to the island, he discovers he'd been set up as he is ambushed by an improved version of the Omnidroid prototype robot, Omnidroid v.X9. The Omnidroid's creator is revealed to be a now adult Buddy Pine, having become a psychotic and incredibly wealthy weapons designer named Syndrome. Embittered by constant rejection from his former idol, he made a fortune in high-tech weapons technology. He then invented the Omnidroid, a robot designed to kill Supers. Syndrome uses his zero-point energy ray to immobilize Mr. Incredible, and after throwing him around a few times, Syndrome accidentally throws Mr. Incredible over a waterfall. Mr. Incredible manages to escape from Syndrome and discovers Gazerbeam's remains in an underground cavern when he narrowly escapes a bomb. While inside the cave, he discovers the word ""Kronos"" etched onto the walls with Gazerbeam’s laser vision. He infiltrates Syndrome's base and gets beyond the wall of lava to his main computer. Typing in the password ""Kronos"", he gains access to all of Syndrome's files. He learns that Syndrome has built many other robots to kill Supers, while it is presumed nearly all of them are dead. He also discovers that Syndrome is now planning on unleashing the robot into the city of Metroville where it will cause mass destruction according to a plan which Syndrome called Project Kronos.
Back at home, Helen notices that Bob's old super suit has recently been repaired. She visits Edna and learns that he has resumed superhero work behind her back. With a call to Insuricare, she also realizes that Bob is no longer employed. Edna reveals to Helen about the new super suits for her and the children, and advises her to take control of the situation. Helen activates the homing device Edna built into Bob's super suit, which inadvertently reveals his location to both her and Syndrome who recaptures him. She heads for the island in a fast jet, on which Violet and Dash have stowed away, after leaving Jack-Jack at home with a babysitter, Kari. Syndrome, meanwhile, tortures Mr. Incredible for information and launches a missile attack against Helen’s now Elastigirl after dawning her new suit out of suspicion something may be wrong on the airplane, which shocks even Mirage when it is revealed that there are children aboard. Elastigirl and the kids manage to escape unharmed, and swim to the island, though everyone on the island believes they are dead. Enraged at Syndrome for apparently killing his family, Mr. Incredible grabs Mirage and threatens to kill her unless Syndrome frees him, Syndrome calls his bluff, and Mr. Incredible releases her unharmed, remaining Syndrome's prisoner. Mirage is furious at Syndrome for gambling with her life, and his belief that Mr. Incredible’s value of life is a weakness. In spite of calling his bluff, she leaves and says next time he gambles, he should bet his own life.While Elastigirl infiltrates Syndrome's base, the new and improved Omnidroid v.10 is loaded and launched on a rocket towards its target, Metroville. In Syndrome's base, a remorseful Mirage secretly frees Mr. Incredible just before Elastigirl arrives. The two superheroes rush to find their children, who are fighting off Syndrome’s henchmen. Dash races the guards through the jungle on foot and discovers he can run on water, and Violet holds her ground against the guards with her invisibility. When the family reunites, a battle ensues, where in the family co-operates to defeat their attackers.However, Syndrome arrives and captures the Incredibles using his zero-point energy beams. Upon capturing them, Syndrome is surprised to find that Mr. Incredible married Elastigirl and had kids with her. Syndrome then explains his plan to them in the containment unit to save Metroville from the Omnidroid and thereby become a hero. Mr. Incredible then figures out that for the past 15 years, Syndrome has been inviting other real heroes to Nomanisan too, and killing them so he could perfect the Omnidroid's final design. With the final design now in place, he plans to pretend to be a hero to bring the Supers back into the spotlight. After that, he'll sell all his gadgets and inventions to the world once his career is finished, thus making everyone super. At that point, the possession of superpowers no longer unique, claiming when everyone is super, no one will be, revealing that the whole idea of Project Kronos was to make the word ""super"" meaningless. He then leaves the Incredibles in an energy prison to put his finishing touches on phase 3. Violet’s force fields allow them to escape, but not before Mr. Incredible reveals that none of this would be happening if he hadn’t been so held up in the past. With Mirage's help, they depart for the mainland after Syndrome with a rocket.In Metroville, Syndrome attempts to stop the Omnidroid's destructive rampage, but the robot becomes self aware the 08 did, figures out the nature of his remote control, and knocks him unconscious. The Incredibles and Frozone fight the robot and do everything they can to stop it before it completely destroys the city. Mr. Incredible realizes that the only way to defeat the Omnidroid is on the inside like he did the last time. After getting ahold of the remote and figuring out how it works, the Incredibles use the remote for one of the claws that was shot earlier to activate it. The thrusters in the claw allows him to launch it like a missile at the robot, impaling and destroying it once and for all. The town applauds them for their achievements, the possibility of superheroes coming out of hiding is mentioned by Dicker. Syndrome wakes up to find that the Incredibles have stolen his glory and his dark future.Rick Dicker drives the Incredibles home, telling them that the United States government has frozen Syndrome's assets and put a warrant out for his arrest. Elastigirl listens to the messages left by Kari and learn that a replacement came over, so they hurry to their house only to find that Syndrome is kidnapping Jack-Jack, intending to raise him as his sidekick, in revenge for his future being taken away. As Syndrome attempts to fly up to his jet using his rocket boots, Jack-Jack suddenly reveals that he does indeed have super powers after all: shapeshifting. His forms consisted of fire, metal, and then an imp-like monster. Syndrome drops Jack-Jack, who is caught by Elastigirl, and attempts to flee, declaring that he will make another attempt to abduct Jack-Jack in the future. Bob, having had enough of Syndrome, hurls the family car into the jet, Syndrome is knocked into the turbine and his cape is caught in the engine quickly becomes a super smoothie. Violet, having mastered her force field powers, protects the family from the raining flames and debris as the jet explodes, much to the amazement of their young neighbor.Three months later, the family is much happier, even Bob is content with their civilian life. Dash is running in a track meet, he carefully controls his use of super-speed and finishes in second place. Violet, who formerly felt alienated to the point of using her hair to hide her face, is found with her hair pulled back, talking to a friend of hers and successfully asking Tony Rydinger for a date to the movies. As they walk out of the sports complex, a new villain, The Underminer, rises from the ground and declares war on peace and happiness. The family members, including Jack-Jack, put on their masks and prepare to fight the new villain.",https://pixar.fandom.com/wiki/The_Incredibles#Plot

Chicken Little,"Chicken Little is the 46th full-length film in the Disney Animated Canon. It premiered in Los Angeles, California on October 30, 2005, and was released in theaters nationwide on November 4, 2005. It was directed by Mark Dindal with screenplay by Steve Bencich, Ron J. Friedman, and Ron Anderson and story by Mark Kennedy and Dindal.The film was animated in-house at Walt Disney Feature Animation's main headquarters in Burbank, California and released by Walt Disney Pictures on November 4, 2005, in Disney Digital 3-D (the first film to be released in this format) along with the standard 2-D version. It is Disney's first fully computer-animated film, as Pixar's films were distributed but not produced by Disney, and Dinosaur (2000) was a combination of live-action and computer animation. It is also Disney's second adaption of the fable of the same name, the first being a 1943 cartoon made during World War II.[2]The film is also the last Disney animated film made before John Lasseter became chief creative officer of Disney Animation. Though it received mixed reviews upon release, the film was a box office success, grossing $314 million worldwide.","In the small town of Oakey Oaks, Chicken Little rings the school bell and warns everyone to run for their lives. This sends the whole town into a frenzied panic. Eventually, the Chief of the local Fire Department comes in to ask him what's going on, and he explains that a piece of the sky shaped like a stop sign had fallen on his head when he was sitting under the big oak tree in the town square; however, he is unable to find the piece. His father, Buck Cluck, assumes that this ""piece of sky"" was actually just an acorn that had fallen off the tree and had hit him on the head, making Chicken Little the laughingstock of the town.A year later, Chicken Little has become infamous in the town for being crazy. His only friends are a brand of outcasts like himself: Abby Mallard (who has a crush on him), Runt of the Litter (who is extremely large), and Fish Out of Water (who wears a helmet full of tap water). Trying to help, Abby encourages Chicken Little to talk to his father, but he really only wants to make his dad proud of him. As a result, he joins his school's baseball team to recover his reputation and his father's pride but is made last until the ninth inning of the last game. Chicken Little is reluctantly called to bat by the coach (even though the coach is certain that he will lose the game for them). Chicken Little is able to hit the ball and make it past first, second, and third bases but is met at home plate by the outfielders. He tries sliding onto the home plate but is touched by the ball. While it's presumed he is out and thus lost the game, the umpire brushes away the dust to reveal Chicken Little's foot barely touching home plate, thus declaring Chicken Little safe and the game won; Chicken Little is hailed as a hero for winning the pennant.Later that night back at home, he is hit on the head by the same ""piece of the sky"" — only to find out that it is not a piece of the sky, but a device that blends into the background (which would thereby explain why Chicken Little was unable to find it last time). He calls his friends over to help figure out what it is.When Fish pushes a button on the back of the hexagon, it flies into the sky, taking Fish with it. It turns out to be part of the camouflage of an invisible UFO. The quartet explores the vessel for clues. Runt then discovers a map that depicts choosing the right planet for a potential invasion and their planet earth is the one they eventually chose, much to everyone's horror. Chicken Little manages to ring the bell to warn everyone while being chased by two alien robots who spotted the intruders, but the aliens see the crowds coming and manage to escape, leaving an orange alien child behind, which Chicken Little encountered earlier in a tank. No one believes the alien invasion story, even with his friends confirmation, and Chicken Little is ridiculed yet again... until the next day. He and his friends discover the orange alien whose name is Kirby, and a few minutes later, a whole fleet of alien ships descend on the town and start what appears to be an invasion as intended on the visualized map from onboard. The invasion is actually a misunderstanding, as the two aliens are looking for their lost child and attack only out of concern. As the aliens rampage throughout Oakey Oaks, vaporizing everything in their path, Chicken Little realizes he must return Kirby to his parents to save the planet. First, though, he must confront his father and regain his trust with his friends help.In the invasion, Buck, now regaining his pride and trust in his son, defends him from the aliens with his friends alongside him. They reach the top of the Town Hall until they get vaporized. It is then discovered that the aliens weren't vaporizing animals and objects; the ray guns teleported them to a chamber aboard the UFO. The red three eyed alien, Melvin, accuses Buck and Chicken Little of abducting their son. But Buck honestly admits that the aliens were the ones who left him behind by mistake. But, despite the claim, Melvin attempts to disintegrate the Clucks for violating one their intergalactic laws. The yellow alien, Tina, intervenes the execution and, with help from Kirby, tells his husband that they were telling the truth about what happened. Tina then has Melvin disarm the weapons and activate the gravity in the chamber setting them on the ground. The aliens reveal themselves in their two giant robot suits as the same species as Kirby is. Afterward, the aliens return everything to normal (except Foxy Loxy, whose brain got scrambled, as reported by an alien security officer, turning her into a Southern Belle, and as a result, Runt falls in love with her). Melvin and Tina reveal that they actually come to earth every year on the way to their in-laws to find acorns since Oakey Oaks has some the best acorns they have. And it also reveals that the panel on their ship is the same one that hit Chicken Little's head since it unexpectedly falls when they come to earth every year. Melvin gives gratitude to Buck for being a good father and soon they say their goodbyes and fly back to their home planet. everyone is grateful for Chicken Little's efforts to save the town. So much that it inspired a sci-fi movie based on the turn of events.",https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Chicken_Little_(film)

The Lion King,"The Lion King is an animated, musical/drama feature film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation as the 32nd film in the Disney Animated Canon. Containing elements of Hamlet and Macbeth by William Shakespeare, the story centers a lion prince named Simba, who must overcome the loss of his father and his villainous uncle, Scar, in order to take his rightful place as the king of the Pride Lands","The story of The Lion King takes place in an African kingdom called the Pride Lands, where a lion rules over the other animals as king.In the lands of Africa, in the ""Circle of Life"", Rafiki, a mandrill shaman, anoints Simba, the newborn cub of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, and presents him to a gathering of animals at Pride Rock. Meanwhile, Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, who decided not to be at the ceremony, is annoyed that he is no longer the heir to the throne. Mufasa confronts Scar about not attending the ceremony and says to not turn his back on him when he tries to leave. When Scar says Mufasa should not turn his back on him and Mufasa asks him if it is a challenge, Scar replies that he would not dream of it as he lacks brute strength. After Scar leaves, Mufasa wonders what to do with him.A few years later, Mufasa shows a young Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the ""circle of life"", which connects all living things. Meanwhile, Scar plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala into exploring a forbidden elephant graveyard. Simba, Nala and Zazu heads off to the watering hole rather as he ""just can't wait to be king"". Simba and Nala makes it to the elephant graveyard, where they are chased by three hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed, who are in league with Scar. Mufasa is alerted of the incident by Zazu and rescues the cubs. Though disappointed in Simba, Mufasa eventually forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.Later that night, Scar gains the loyalty of the hyenas by claiming that if he becomes king, they will ""never go hungry again"" if they help him kill Mufasa and Simba with ""Be Prepared"". Plotting further, Scar gathers more hyenas forming an army. Sometime later, Scar lures Simba into a gorge for a ""surprise from his father"" then signals the hyenas to create a wildebeest stampede down into the gorge where Simba is. Alerted by an insincerely dramatic Scar, Mufasa races to rescue Simba from the stampede. He saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a cliff, which results in Scar flinging him into the stampede below to his death. Scar convinces Simba that he was responsible for his own father's death and recommends that he flees the Pride Lands, never to return. To compound this, Scar once again sends the hyenas to kill Simba, but as Simba reaches a thorny embankment, they let him escape, hurling threats that he will be killed if ever seen again. That night back at Pride Rock, Scar informs Sarabi, Nala, and the rest of the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and that he is assuming the throne as the closest of kin. After becoming king, Scar fulfills his promise to the hyenas and allows them to come into the Pride Lands.Simba collapses in a distant desert where he is found unconscious by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat-warthog duo who raise Simba under their carefree ""Hakuna Matata"" lifestyle. When Simba has grown into a young adult, he saves them from a hungry lioness revealed to be Nala. Simba shows Nala around his home, and the two begin to fall in love with ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"". Nala then tells him that Scar's tyrannical reign has turned the Pride Lands into a barren wasteland; she demands that Simba return and take his rightful place as king, but Simba refuses, still guilty about supposedly causing his father's death. Rafiki arrives and persuades Simba to return to the Pride Lands, assisted by Mufasa's presence in the stars. After some advice from Rafiki and the ghost of his father, Simba, followed by Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa, returns home.Once back at Pride Rock, Simba (with Timon, Pumbaa, and Nala) is horrified to see the condition of the Pride Lands. What was once a lush paradise was now a dead wasteland. With the overhunting, the prey eventually left the Pride Lands, causing famine in the pride. After seeing Scar strike his mother that he is ""ten times the king Mufasa was"", Simba announces his return. In response, Simba confronts Scar, who forces Simba to confess to being responsible for Mufasa's death. Scar then forces Simba over the edge of Pride Rock, just as a lightning bolt starts a fire below. As Simba dangles over the edge of Pride Rock, Scar whispers to Simba that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba leaps up and pins Scar to the ground, forcing him to admit the truth to the pride. A raging battle ensues between the hyenas and the lionesses, Timon, and Pumbaa, which results in Simba cornering Scar. Amid their fight, Scar tries to surreptitiously blame everything on the hyenas, but the hyenas overhear his conversation with Simba and back away growling. Simba orders Scar to flee the Pride Lands. Scar pretends to leave but turns to attack Simba, resulting in a final duel. Simba eventually overpowers Scar by kicking and hurling him over a low cliff. Scar initially survives the fall but finds himself surrounded by the now resentful hyenas. The hyenas surround their traitorous fallen leader. Scar frantically tries to absolve himself, but the hyenas finally had enough of his lies, derogatory treatment, and violated promises, so they ignore his life plea, attack him, and maul him to death, as flames rise around and engulf them.With Scar and the hyenas gone, and with the rightful king in place, the Pride Lands are restored which is turning green with life again. The film concludes with Rafiki presenting Simba and Nala's newborn cub into the air, thus continuing the Circle of Life.",https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lion_King#Plot
The Little Mermaid,"The Little Mermaid is a 1989 musical comedy fantasy animated film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation. It was first released on November 17, 1989 by Walt Disney Pictures, but returned to theaters on November 14, 1997. The 28th animated feature in the Disney Animated Canon, and the first to be released during the Disney Renaissance, the film is loosely based upon the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale of the same name.

The story centers on a young mermaid named Ariel, who is captivated by the world upon the surface. When she falls in love with a human prince, she makes a deal with a villainous sea witch to become human, herself, and must earn his love before the agreed time runs out.

The Little Mermaid was an unmitigated success for the studio, being praised for its animation, storytelling, and music by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. The movie grossed over $100 million at the US box office upon its initial release and won two Academy Awards for Best Song (""Under the Sea"") and Best Original Music Score. It is credited as the film to have started the historic Disney Renaissance, an era that had breathed life back into the animated feature film medium after a string of competent, but only inexpensive successful animated films such as The Aristocats, The Rescuers, and The Great Mouse Detective.

Following The Little Mermaid were two direct-to-video sequels (The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea and The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning) and an animated television series that ran from 1992 to 1994. A decade after the film's release, Ariel would be inaugurated into the Disney Princess media line, while Ursula would appear as a staple character in the Disney Villains franchise. In 2007, a stage adaptation of the film made its Broadway debut. A live-action reimagining based on the 1989 animation, and featuring the music of Alan Menken and Lin-Manuel Miranda, was released on May 26, 2023.

In 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".","""The film begins on a foggy morning out on the open sea. A ship then comes from the fog, filled with sailors singing stories of the legendary merfolk. (""""Fathoms Below"""") Aboard that ship is a young prince, named Eric, his dog Max, and his advisor Grimsby, who denounces the merfolk as, """"nautical nonsense,"""" but one sailor insists them to be real. While distracted by Grimsby, a fish the sailor was holding slips from him and falls back into the ocean.
The fish breathes a sigh of relief before swimming away from the ship. The opening credits play as the fish crosses the deep ocean until at last, we see merfolk. They then make their way through the ocean towards a shining underwater castle located in an aquatic kingdom called Atlantica. The castle is the domain of King Triton and is where he was holding a concert in his name, performed by his seven daughters and the crab court composer, Sebastian. (""""Daughters of Triton"""")
The concert goes as planned until it is discovered that Triton's youngest daughter, Ariel, is not there, much to his anger. As it turned out, Ariel was out excavating a ship graveyard with her best friend, Flounder the Fish. Inside one wreck, she finds a pipe and a fork, which fascinates her curiosity, all the while unaware of a shark watching her and Flounder from outside.
The shark bursts into the room Ariel and Flounder are in and gives chase to them, all across the graveyard, until the two manage to get the shark ensnared in an anchor ring. They then make their way to the surface, where their friend, a seagull named Scuttle, lives. Ariel asks Scuttle to tell her what the items she collected are. He describes the fork as a dinglehopper, an item humans use to style hair; and the pipe as a snarfblatt, an object for making music.
Upon hearing the word """"music"""", Ariel is quickly reminded of the concert she missed and makes haste back home. However, Ariel fails to realize she is being watched by two suspicious eels by the names of Flotsam and Jetsam. The two are spies under the employ of Ursula the Sea Witch, a member of King Triton's court before being banished. Ursula hates Triton with a passion for his atrocities towards her, and constantly schemes of ways to exact revenge. The moment Ariel caught her eye, Ursula commanded her cronies to watch her, hoping to use her to get to the king.
The film then moves to the royal palace, where Triton and Sebastian are scolding Ariel for missing the concert. But Flounder moves in to defend her, accidentally letting slip the encounter with Scuttle, which quickly angers Triton. The law of his kingdom forbids going to the surface world for fears of merfolk being caught by humans. But Ariel believes humans not to be all that bad, which angers Triton to the point of telling her that as long as she is living under his ocean, she'll do what he says and what she does not want. And this sends Ariel away crying, with Flounder following after.
When they've left, Triton asks Sebastian if he was too hard on Ariel, to which Sebastian replies, """"definitely not."""" Sebastian suggests that Ariel needs constant supervision, which gives Triton the idea to send Sebastian to keep an eye on her. Sebastian complies with the King's demands but feels dissatisfied with the idea of, """"tagging along some headstrong teenager."""" However, Sebastian's thoughts are interrupted when he sees Ariel and Flounder swimming off elsewhere, prompting him to follow her. He is led to a hidden grotto where he discovers a variety of human objects gathered together.
Ariel with her collection
Ariel admiring her collection, but dreams of someday living in the human world.
Still hurt by her father's words and not trusting him, Ariel sings of her collection of human objects, and how she desires to visit the world of humans, despite what her father had to say of them. (""""Part of Your World"""") The mood is quickly broken by Sebastian crashing in, and threatening to reveal Ariel's grotto to the king. Ariel attempts to reason with him, but before anything could be resolved in the conflict, a large object is seen floating overhead blocking moonlight from the grotto roof. Ariel, being ever curious, swims to the surface to figure out what this massive object was. The object proves to be a human ship, shooting fireworks into the night sky. Ariel swims towards the vessel, in spite of Sebastian's protests, and climbs aboard to behold dancing seamen. Ariel learns that the humans aboard are celebrating the birthday of their prince; one creature that catches her eye is Max, the sheepdog who takes a liking to Ariel. But Ariel is left enamored when she sees the dog's master, Prince Eric, who receives a large, gaudy statue of himself as a birthday present, from Grimsby, who sourly proclaims that he hoped it would be a wedding present. Eric protests that he just had not found the right girl yet, but insists that when he does it will hit him, like lightning. It was then, that the sounds of thunder echoed in the distance, followed by an ever-growing gust of wind.

Without warning, a hurricane blows in, sweeping up both ship and crew violently in a volley of wind and water. The crew rushes to batten the hatches down, but to no avail. Ariel is thrown off the vessel but manages to catch sight of the ship being struck by lightning, setting it on fire. When the ship crashes into a gaggle of rocks, the crew is sent overboard, along with the statue of Eric. Though they all abandon ship and make it to the lifeboats, Eric discovers that Max is still on the burning vessel and goes off to rescue him. Unfortunately, while Eric manages to get Max to safety, he cannot save himself when he gets blown away by a massive explosion caused by the onboard gunpowder and lands into the ocean below underwater. While she witnesses this and rushes towards his aid, Ariel rescues Eric and takes him back to shore.

Once at the shore, Ariel sings of her desire to join Eric's world before fleeing at the sounds of Grimsby and Max approaching. While Ariel sings, Eric only manages to catch a glimpse of her before she leaves; but as Grimsby raises him up, Eric vividly remembers a girl who had saved him and is determined to find her. As Ariel watches them from a nearby rock, Sebastian tells her that the situation must be kept secret from her father, but Ariel does not pay attention. Instead, with vigor and determination, Ariel makes a bold proclamation that she will be a part of Eric's world.

However, what Ariel does not realize is that she's being watched by Ursula's eels. Ursula is gleeful of the situation and eerily looks to a gaggle of polyps in her lair, all former dreamers who came to her power. She then mutters about Ariel becoming a charming addition to the group.

A few days later, Ariel spends her time daydreaming of Eric, which piques the curiosity of her father and her sisters, who believes Ariel to be in love with another merman. All the while, Sebastian is a nervous wreck trying to keep the secret from being found out. Ariel then decides that she wants to visit Eric, but Sebastian is having none of that. He attempts to bring her down to earth with a musical number about how the sea is better than the land (""""Under the Sea"""").

Sebastian manages to bring many fish together to sing along, but as this party is happening, Flounder shows up and manages to slip Ariel away unnoticed. By the time the song ends, Ariel is nowhere to be seen, and Sebastian is left alone to grumble about her. Suddenly, the royal herald calls for Sebastian to report to the King about Ariel. Sebastian, afraid that Triton figured out what has happened, accidentally slips the truth during the meeting and is forced to tell the King everything, much to his fury. Back at Ariel's grotto, Flounder reveals that he had saved the statue of Eric from the wreck, much to Ariel's delight. However, the pleasantries are cut short when Triton arrives at the grotto with Sebastian behind. After a short argument, Ariel confronts Triton and tells him that she rescued Eric from drowning to death, and she loves him. Horrified by her words, the enraged Triton confronts Ariel and blasts all the secret treasures in her grotto and reduces them to a junk pile with his trident. When Triton even blasts the statue of Eric into pieces, Ariel breaks down and begins weeping. After a now remorseful Triton leaves, feeling extremely regretful, ashamed and guilty over what he had done, a weeping Ariel tells Sebastian and Flounder to leave her alone to grieve, not allowing them to comfort her.

However, unbeknownst to her, Flotsam and Jetsam enter the grotto and sweet talk Ariel into going to Ursula to achieve her dreams of being with Eric. Not trusting Triton, Ariel accepts with an escort from Flotsam and Jetsam who send her to Ursula. As they leave, Sebastian tries to warn Ariel about Ursula, but she doesn't want to hear it as she is still angry with him for telling her father. Flounder and Sebastian follow after Ariel all the way to Ursula's lair. Ursula comforts Ariel and explains that she can grant Ariel's wish to be human for three days, but she must give Eric the kiss of true love before the sunset on the third day, or she belongs to Ursula. (""""Poor Unfortunate Souls"""") Flotsam and Jetsam interrupt Flounder and Sebastian attempting to stop Ariel. In exchange for legs, though, she must give away her voice. Ariel agrees to these terms and signs the contract, trapping her voice in a necklace Ursula wears, and giving her human legs.

Once Ariel has been transformed into a human, Sebastian and Flounder escape Flotsam and Jetsam's grasps and help take her to the surface as Ariel can no longer breathe underwater. After making it to shore the group meets up with Scuttle on a beach near Eric's castle. Sebastian threatens to tell King Triton about the deal Ariel made with Ursula, but Ariel manages to convince him to help the group as she loves Eric and she would be miserable if she went home. Scuttle then tells Ariel about how to blend in with humans, and the first step is to dress like them. Next, Scuttle takes a portion of a sail and some rope for Ariel to wear, just as Prince Eric arrives at their location. Though Eric does not know she's the girl who saved his life, he is willing to bring her to his castle to be taken care of, with Sebastian tagging along in a pocket in Ariel's sailcloth.

Later, inside the palace, while Ariel is taking a bath, Sebastian is sent, through a series of unfortunate events, to the castle kitchen. It's there that Sebastian encounters a seafood-obsessed chef who attempts to cook him. (""""Les Poissons"""") As this conflict goes on in the kitchen, Ariel meets with Eric and Grimsby in the dining hall for dinner, where the two men discuss giving Ariel a tour of the kingdom, to which she agrees. Later that night, Ariel watches Eric play with his dog Max and goes off to bed. Sebastian discusses plans to get Eric to kiss Ariel, though Ariel does not listen, being too enamored in the human world's splendors. Finally, after Ariel falls asleep, Sebastian tells her she is """"completely hopeless"""" and drifts off.

Back in King Triton's palace, the situation is grim. King Triton has sent several search parties looking everywhere for Ariel and Sebastian, but not a single trace of either one has been found anywhere. Triton tells his squire (a seahorse) to keep looking and not rest until they're found. Triton is left in grave remorse over his actions, blaming himself for Ariel's disappearance.

Little-mermaid-1080p-disneyscreencaps
Ariel and Eric almost kiss.

The next morning, Ariel and Eric begin their tour of the kingdom, starting with the nearby town. Ariel is enamored by every single thing she sees, whether it's puppets, horses, or dancing. The day passes into the evening when Eric takes Ariel on a lagoon cruise. Sebastian, seeing this as the perfect moment, decides to take matters into his own claws, and plays a song to motivate the two into kissing (""""Kiss the Girl""""). However, Flotsam and Jetsam quickly interrupt the song and overturn the boat, successfully ruining the mood.

Frustrated with the progress Ariel's making, Ursula decides to take matters into her own tentacles and transforms herself into a beautiful young maiden named Vanessa. She then uses Ariel's voice to hypnotize Eric before announcing his true feelings to Ariel. The next morning, Eric and Vanessa are announced to be wed by sunset, leaving poor Ariel heartbroken as the wedding ship departs from a port. Ariel and her friends are left behind while Vanessa convincingly plays her role as a love-struck woman, constantly clinging to Eric's side, raising no suspicion. While Ariel witnesses the ship sailing off, she begins weeping over Eric's loss.

Little does anyone know, Scuttle happens to fly over the wedding ship when he hears Ariel's voice coming from the bride's dressing room. He spies from a porthole, and once Vanessa takes a look at the dressing room's mirror, Ursula's reflection is shown. Realizing that Vanessa is really Ursula in disguise, Scuttle flies off to inform Ariel and the group about Ursula and her plot. The group has to think fast as the sun is setting, so they come up with a plan: Ariel and Flounder go after the wedding ship on a barrel and Sebastian goes to tell King Triton what's happening, while Scuttle goes off to stall the wedding.

Scuttle gathers lagoon and sea critters of all sorts (including bluebirds, flamingos, pelicans, lobsters, starfish, dolphins, and seals) to converge on the wedding ship as the wedding is just underway. There is a little warning for Vanessa when the attack begins, and the ship is sent into disarray, giving to Ariel the time she needs to get aboard. Moreover, Vanessa is utterly flustered, disoriented, and sidelined from being able to do anything. Thanks to the help of Max, Scuttle manages to snap the necklace off Vanessa's neck, shattering it across the deck, returning Ariel's voice back to her, and releasing Eric from the spell. Eric finds Ariel and admits she's the one who saved him, but Vanessa warns Eric to leave Ariel alone before realizing that her voice was now Ursula's voice after her shell broke. But before the two can kiss, the sun sets, and Ariel turns back into a mermaid. Vanessa transforms back to Ursula, grabs Ariel and jumps back into the sea with her.

It is not long before Ursula has Ariel to herself and thinks of her next move and runs into Triton and Sebastian, and a conflict occurs. Triton confronts Ursula and demands her to release Ariel, but to no avail. Ursula counters by insisting that Ariel is her slave. After Triton hears Ariel apologizing to him, he attempts to destroy the contract she signed, binding her to Ursula, but finds that he is unable to due to being magically enhanced by being legal. So, Triton spares Ariel by signing the contract and becoming a polyp in her place as a prisoner to Ursula.

Meanwhile, Eric takes a rowboat from the wedding ship heading to Ariel's location to help his endangered love. Ursula claims Triton's crown and trident and becomes queen of the sea, which angers Ariel to the point of attacking her. Ariel confronts Ursula and abuses her. When Ursula attempts to use the trident to sabotage Ariel, Eric dives into the ocean below underwater and strikes Ursula in the arm with a harpoon. Ariel reminds Eric to look out while Ursula commands Flotsam and Jetsam to drown him. Eric struggles to swim to shore and attempts to pull himself onto a boat, but is pulled down by Flotsam and Jetsam. Witnessing the commotion and to save Eric by coming to his aid, Flounder and Sebastian attack Flotsam and Jetsam.

The Wrath of Ursula
Ursula's wrath.

Amid the chaos, Ursula attempts to use the trident to destroy Eric, but a furious Ariel intervenes and stops Ursula by pulling on her hair, causing her to miss Eric and vaporize Flotsam and Jetsam instead, reducing them to ashes. Ursula mourns their loss before vengefully turning to the ones responsible. As Ariel hurries to join Eric, the enraged Ursula spouts black ink and begins to enlarge herself. Ariel attempts to tell Eric to save himself, but he refuses to abandon her, just as Ursula's gigantic form about the size of a kraken emerges, leaving Eric and Ariel helpless to her power. During her rampage, Ursula creates a whirlpool, raising shipwrecks from the ocean floor. Eric pulls himself into the ship with a splintered bowsprit. Saving herself from Ursula who attempts to sabotage her, Ariel avoids the trident's blasts and begins to escape.

Just as Ursula prepares to destroy Ariel with the trident's blasts, Eric saves Ariel and kills Ursula by ramming a splintered bowsprit towards the evil witch's abdomen. Ursula dies by blowing up into a scattered mass of organs. While Ariel is safe from harm, Eric makes it to the shore and passes out on the beach. After Ursula is murdered and her remains sink to the ocean floor, her curse is lifted from the merfolk in her garden, as well as King Triton, and peace is once again restored to the ocean now that Triton has regained his crown, trident, and kingdom as a whole.

ArielMarriage
They lived happily ever after.

Back on the surface, Triton observes Ariel looking at Eric and realizes she really does love him. After talking with Sebastian, Triton decides that he has to let Ariel be free to lead her own life and tells Sebastian that he will miss her. He then transforms her once more into a human - this time permanently. Triton sends Ariel to Eric to be together again. Eric asks Ariel to marry him, to which she agrees, they finally kiss, and the two are immediately wed shortly after. At this ceremony, after Ariel and Eric are married onboard the wedding ship, Ariel bids her friends and family, including her six older sisters, her father Triton, Sebastian, Flounder, and Scuttle, farewell to live her new life in Eric's surface world of humans. But not after Sebastian is chased by Chef Louis once again in an attempt to cook him, but easily outsmarts him. The film ends with the wedding ship sailing away under a rainbow Triton creates with his trident and Ariel and Eric kissing as the screen fades to black.""",https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid
Lady and the Tramp,"Lady and the Tramp is a 1955 American animated romance film produced by Walt Disney. It premiered on June 16, 1955, and was originally released to theaters on June 22 by Buena Vista Film Distribution, making it the first Disney animated film to not be distributed by RKO Radio Pictures. The 15th animated feature in the Disney Animated Canon, it was the first animated feature filmed in the CinemaScope Widescreen film process. The story, which was based the book Happy Dan the Whistling Dog by Ward Greene, centers on a female American Cocker Spaniel named Lady, who lives with a refined, upper-middle-class family, and a male stray mutt named Tramp. A direct-to-video sequel, Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure, was released in 2001. While not a runaway hit at first, it is now considered one of Disney's greatest classics.
In 2019, Disney released a live-action adaptation of the film, with the same name.","On December 25, 1909, Jim Dear gives his wife, Darling a Cocker Spaniel puppy whom she names Lady. Growing up, Lady enjoys a happy life with them and a pair of dogs from the neighborhood, a Scottish Terrier named Jock and a bloodhound named Trusty. Meanwhile, across town by the railway, a friendly stray silver mutt, referred to as Tramp, dreams to live in a home, be it begging for scraps from an Italian restaurant or protecting his fellow strays, a Pekingese named Peg and a bulldog named Bull, from the local dogcatcher. At one point, Lady sees a big, sinister-looking rat trying to sneak into the yard and chases it away.

Later, Lady is saddened after Jim Dear and Darling begin treating her rather coldly. Jock and Trusty visit her and determine that the change in behavior is due to Darling expecting a baby. While Jock and Trusty try to explain what one is, the eavesdropping Tramp enters the conversation and offers his own opinions. Jock and Trusty take an immediate dislike to him and order him out of the yard.

In due time, baby Jim Jr. arrives and Jim Dear and Darling introduce Lady to him. Soon after, Jim Dear and Darling decide to go on a trip together, leaving their Aunt Sarah to look after Jim Jr. and the house. When Lady clashes with Aunt Sarah's two Siamese cats, Si and Am, she takes Lady to a pet shop to get a muzzle. A terrified Lady escapes but is pursued by some stray dogs. Tramp sees the chase and rescues her. They then visit the zoo, where Tramp tricks a beaver into removing the muzzle. That night, Tramp shows Lady how he lives ""footloose and collar-free"", culminating in a candlelit spaghetti dinner.

As Tramp escorts Lady back home, his last thing is to chase hens in a chicken coop and then he is through being a stray. When they flee, Lady is caught by the dogcatcher. At the pound, the other dogs admire her license, as it is her way out of there. It also turns out that they have known Tramp, and the dogs reveal to Lady that Tramp's had multiple girlfriends in the past and feel it's unlikely that he'll ever settle down. Eventually, Lady is collected by Aunt Sarah, who chains her to her doghouse in the backyard. Trusty and Jock visit to comfort her and tell her that strays aren't allowed to be adopted. When Tramp arrives to apologize, thunder starts to rumble as she angrily confronts him about his ""past sweethearts,"" after which he sadly leaves.

Moments later, as it starts to rain, Lady sees the same rat from before trying to sneak into the yard again. While it is afraid of her, it is able to evade her and enter the house. She barks frantically, but Aunt Sarah yells at her to be quiet. Tramp hears her and runs back to help. He enters the house and finds the rat in Jim Jr.'s room, and the two engage in a vicious fight. Lady breaks free and races inside to find the rat on Jim Jr.'s crib, as it had intended on killing him. Tramp pounces on it but accidentally knocks over the crib in the process, awakening Jim Jr. Tramp kills the rat, but when Aunt Sarah comes to Jim Jr.'s aid, she didn’t see the rat, and she thinks they are responsible for attacking the baby. Aunt Sarah forces Tramp into a closet and Lady into the cellar before calling the pound to take Tramp away.

Jim Dear and Darling return as the dogcatcher departs with Tramp. They release Lady, who leads them and Aunt Sarah to the dead rat, vindicating Tramp. Having overheard everything, Trusty and Jock felt ashamed for how they mistreated and misjudged Tramp badly. To redeem themselves, they decided to chase after the dogcatcher’s wagon and rescue him. Jock is convinced Trusty has long since lost his sense of smell, but the latter is able to find the wagon. When Trusty and Jock raced to the wagon, they bark at the horses who rear up and topple the wagon onto a telephone pole. Jim Dear arrives by car with Lady, and she is happily reunited with Tramp. But their happiness is short-lived when they discover that the wagon fell on Trusty, much to Jock’s sadness.

Christmas returns and Tramp is now a part of Lady's family and has his own collar and license as a reward for his heroism. The two dogs now have four puppies together: a son (named Scamp) who looks identical to Tramp and three daughters (named Annette, Collette, and Danielle) who look identical to Lady. Jock and Trusty (who is carefully walking on his still-mending leg) came to see the family. Tramp is happy to have finally become a house dog, and he and Lady live together happily with their children.",https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_and_the_Tramp
Sleeping Beauty ,"Sleeping Beauty is a 1959 animated feature produced by Walt Disney Productions and originally released to theaters on January 29, 1959, by Buena Vista Film Distribution. The 16th animated feature in the Disney Animated Canon, it was the last animated feature produced by Walt Disney to be based upon a fairy tale (after his death, the studio returned to the genre with The Little Mermaid), as well as the last cel animated feature from Disney to be inked by hand before the studio switched to using the xerography process. It is also the first animated feature to be shot in Super Technirama 70, one of many large-format widescreen processes (only one more animated film, The Black Cauldron, has been shot in Super Technirama 70). It spent nearly the whole decade of the 1950s in production: the story work began in 1951, the dialogue was recorded in 1953, animation production took from the same year the dialogue was recorded until 1958, and the musical score by George Bruns, drawn almost entirely from the ballet Spyashchaya krasavitsa by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, was recorded in the same year animation production finished.
Due to a problematic production and high costs, the film was originally a box office failure, and did not make up the huge cost of the film. Along with the mixed critical reception, it was also noted to be the film that caused Walt Disney to lose interest in the animation medium. However, the subsequent re-releases proved massively successful, and critics and audiences have since praised it as a beautiful animated classic.","In 14th Century Europe, King Stefan and Queen Leah have a daughter, whom they called her Aurora. Everyone was invited to the christening ceremony, where baby Aurora is betrothed to Young Prince Phillip, the son of her dad's friend who rules a neighboring kingdom, King Hubert. Stefan and Hubert wanted to unite their respective kingdoms through a future marriage between their respective children.

At the Princess's christening, the royal herald announces the arrival of the three good fairies who came to bless her; Flora (in red), Fauna (in green), and Merryweather (in blue).

Flora gives her the gift of beauty, which is described in a song as ""gold of sunshine in her hair"" and ""lips that shame the red, red rose.""
Fauna gives her the gift of song, so she may sing like a nightingale.
But before Merryweather can give her gift to the princess, Maleficent, a wicked fairy and self-proclaimed ""mistress of all evil,"" appears on the scene. Angered at not being invited to the christening, she curses Aurora to die when she pricks her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, leaving everyone horrified about Aurora's doomed future and her frightened mother grabs her infant daughter from the bed in horror. A furious Stefan orders his guards to seize Maleficent, who disappears.

However, Flora and Fauna point out to Stefan that Merryweather hasn't given her gift to Aurora yet. While Maleficent's magic is far too powerful for Merryweather to undo the curse, she does use her magic to soften the curse, whereby, instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep that will only be undone by Love's First Kiss. Still fearful of his daughter's life, Stefan orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned as a preventative, though the fairies knew that this is not quite successful or effective enough against the curse. Knowing Maleficent is extremely powerful and will stop at nothing to see her curse fulfilled, least of all a ""bonfire"", the fairies take Aurora to live with them in the forest, where they can keep her safe from any harm until she turns sixteen and the curse is made void after which she would be reunited with the king and queen. To protect her fully, they even change her name to Briar Rose to conceal her true identity. The King and Queen agree to the arrangement but are saddened to see their child go. The years pass by and while no one knew what happened to the princess, they became excited as her 16th birthday approached.

In the Forbidden Mountains, Maleficent berates her goons after realizing that they had been looking for a baby for sixteen years. As a last resort, she sends her raven, later named ""Diablo,"" to look for Aurora.

Aurora grows into a very beautiful woman, with sunshine golden blonde hair, rose-red lips, violet eyes, and a beautiful singing voice. She is raised in a cottage in the forest by the fairies, whom she believes are her aunts. On her sixteenth birthday, while out picking berries, she sings to entertain her animal friends; her angelic voice gains the attention of Phillip, who has grown into a handsome young man and is out riding in the woods. While she has not met any other friends she has been dreaming of a handsome prince. When they meet, they instantly fall in love. Realizing that she has to return home, she flees from him without ever learning his name. Back at the cottage, while cleaning up the mess to prepare for Aurora's sixteenth birthday, Merryweather and Flora argue about the color of Aurora's dress for it being blue and or pink, attracting the attention of Diablo, who waits by the cottage. When Aurora returns, despite promising to meet him again, she is unable to return as her ""aunts"" choose that time to reveal the truth of her birth to her and to tell her that she is betrothed to a prince named Phillip, and she is a princess. They also inform her that she'll be returning to her father King Stefan that very night (during this Diablo leaves to send the news about Aurora's discovery to Maleficent). While she tries to tell the fairies, the person she met is coming that night to see her, they tell her in sadness that it will not be and she runs to her room heartbroken, neither she nor the fairies knowing that Aurora's beloved is her betrothed.

Meanwhile, Stefan and Hubert were having a conversation about their children's future, which Hubert even shows Stefan some plans he has for when their children wed. Stefan protest at first reminding Hubert he hasn't seen his daughter since she left, however; Hubert helps him reconsider. Shortly thereafter, Phillip returns home to tell Hubert about a peasant girl he met and wishes to marry despite his prearranged marriage to Aurora. Hubert tries unsuccessfully to convince Phillip to marry Aurora instead of the peasant girl.

Princess Aurora, the titular character in Sleeping Beauty.

The fairies and Aurora return to the castle and give Aurora a crown, she is still saddened and the fairies give her some time to herself. Unfortunately, Maleficent uses her magic to lure Aurora away from her chamber and up into a tower, where an enchanted spinning wheel awaits her. Realizing their mistake of leaving Aurora alone, the fairies go searching everywhere, trying to look for Aurora, but at Maleficent's hypnotic order, Aurora touches the spindle, thereby pricking her finger. By the time the fairies arrive in the same chamber where Aurora pricked her finger, they are too late to save her. They gasped as Maleficent taunts them for their failed attempt to defeat her by revealing the fallen princess and disappearing, cackling in triumph. As had been foretold, Aurora has been put under a sleeping spell. Meanwhile, everyone is awaiting the return of Aurora. Hubert tries to tell Stefan that Phillip has fallen for a peasant girl but the talk is interrupted by a fanfare that was to welcome Aurora. A celebration proceeds with cheers and fireworks, while up in the tower the three fairies cry while laying Aurora on the bed, still upset over their failure. Unwilling to break Stefan and Leah's hearts about Aurora's fate and heartbroken about their failure to protect her, the fairies place her on her bed with a red rose in her hand and cast a powerful spell on everyone in the kingdom, causing a deep sleep to fall over them until the fairies can find a way to break the curse. From a remark made by the drowsy Hubert, they realize that Phillip is both Aurora's beloved and the one fated to break the curse and save the whole kingdom. Realizing that the Prince may be in danger, the fairies leave; but when they arrive at the cottage, they discover that the prince has been kidnapped by Maleficent and her goons in order to prevent him from kissing Aurora and breaking the evil fairy's spell. The good fairies sneak into Maleficent's lair to aid Phillip in escaping, arming him with a magical sword and shield. Warned by Diablo (who got turned into a stone by Merryweather), Maleficent attempts to thwart Phillip from reaching Stefan's castle with her magic and transforming herself into a gigantic fire-breathing dragon. After being cornered on a cliff, he flings his sword and impales her, sending her crashing down in destruction. After Maleficent's death, the prince then climbs up to Aurora's chamber and removes the curse with a kiss. When breaking the curse on Aurora, it allows everyone else in the kingdom, including Stefan, Leah, and Hubert, to wake up from their slumber, thus saving them all from their eternal sleeping spell.

A fanfare announces Aurora and Phillip's arrival in the throne room, where the teenage princess is happily reunited with her parents; she then dances with Phillip, each happy to learn that their betrothed and their beloved are one and the same. As Merryweather and Flora argue over the dress color again, the happy couple waltzes into the clouds and live happily ever after.",https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty
A Bela Adormecida,"A Bela Adormecida é um filme animado americano de 1959 produzido pela Walt Disney Pictures e pela Buena Vista Distribution e originalmente lançado nos cinemas em 29 de janeiro de 1959 nos Estados Unidos e em 6 de fevereiro de 1959 no Brasil. É o décimo sexto filme de animação da Walt Disney Animation Studios, que foi o último produzido por Walt Disney a ser baseado em um conto de fadas ( após sua morte, o estúdio voltou ao gênero com 1989 com A Pequena Sereia), bem como o último filme feito a mão pelo estúdio. A Bela Adormecida é também o primeiro filme animado a ser filmado em Super Technirama 70, um dos maiores formatos widescreen ( apenas o filme O Caldeirão Mágico, foi filmado em Super Technirama 70). O filme passou quase toda a década dos anos de 1950 em produção: o trabalho da história começou a ser feito em 1951, as vozes foram gravadas em 1952, a produção de animação começou de 1953 até 1958, e a partitura musical foi gravada em 1957.","Personagens e desenvolvimento da história
O nome da linda Bela Adormecida é ""Princesa Aurora"" (que significa ""nascer do sol"" ou ""amanhecer"" em Latim, Italiano, Português e Espanhol), neste filme, como no ballet de Tchaivosky; este nome ocorreu na versão de Perrault, não como o nome da princesa, mas como sua filha. No esconderijo, ela é chamada de Briar Rose (do alemão Dornröschen, o nome da princesa na versão dos Irmãos Grimm). O príncipe foi dado o único nome principesco familiar para os americanos na década de 1950: ""O príncipe Phillip"", em homenagem a Filipe, Duque de Edimburgo. A fada má foi apropriadamente chamada de Malévola (que significa ""malfeitor"").

O formato do corpo esguio e longo da princesa Aurora foi inspirado pelo de Audrey Hepburn. Além disso, Walt Disney tinha sugerido que todas as três fadas deviam ser parecidas, mas os animadores veteranos Frank Thomas e Ollie Johnston contrastaram essa ideia dizendo que tê-las como iguais não seria emocionante. Além disso, a ideia incluída originalmente era de sete fadas em vez de três.

Vários pontos da história para o filme veio de ideias descartadas para Branca de Neve. Elas incluem a captura de Malévola do Príncipe e a ousada fuga do mesmo de seu castelo. A Disney descartou essas ideias de Branca de Neve porque seus artistas não foram capazes de desenhar um homem humano com credibilidade no momento.

Live-action de referência da filmagem
Antes do início da produção da animação, cada cena no filme foi feita uma versão referência em live-action, com atores ao vivo em trajes servindo como modelo para os animadores. O papel do príncipe Phillip foi modelado por Ed Kemmer, que tinha interpretado o Comandante Buzz Cory na televisão em Space Patrol cinco anos antes de A Bela Adormecida ser lançado. Para a sequência da batalha final, Kemmer foi fotografado em uma bola de madeira. Entre as atrizes que realizarem referência em filmagens para este filme, incluiu Spring Byington, Frances Bavier (The Andy Griffith Show's ""Aunt Bee""), e Helene Stanley, que foi referência ao vivo para o papel título de 1950 Cinderela.

Todas as performances ao vivo dos atores foram selecionadas para os animadores como referência ou rotocosped (traçado a partir de live-action com animação), como o Walt Disney insistiu que os personagens de A Bela Adormecida fossem o mais perto de live-action possível.",https://disney.fandom.com/pt-br/wiki/A_Bela_Adormecida

En el hermoso submundo, no pasa mucho hasta que Miguel encuentra las almas de su propia familia —el valor de generaciones de ancestros Rivera muertos hace mucho tiempo, pero no menos vivaces, incluida la bisabuela Imelda. Aún así, dada la oportunidad de vagar por la Tierra de los Muertos, Miguel decide rastrear a De la Cruz él mismo. Se alía con otro amigable (y esquelético) espíritu —un timador llamado Héctor, con la voz de Bernal— para encontrar a De La Cruz.

Finalmente, Miguel, tras una larga aventura en la Tierra de los Muertos, logra recibir la bendición de su familia para actuar y regresar a la Tierra de los Vivos antes de que se agote el tiempo y termine convirtiéndose en un esqueleto para siempre.[3]",https://disney.fandom.com/es/wiki/Coco_
